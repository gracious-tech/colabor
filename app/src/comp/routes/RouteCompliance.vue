h1 Character Before Compliance


p In the pursuit of integrity, Christians have added numerous layers of accountability to the receipt of donations. Those in ministry are expected to be part of a reputable organisation with non-profit regulations, multiple board members, independent audits, finance officers, and financial stewardship accreditation.

p Those are often good things but they also introduce a large amount of admin, which is a problem for those starting new ministries or running only small initiatives. Someone starting a ministry can easily find they spend more time dealing with admin then actually doing ministry, and have a substantial amount of donations consumed by admin expenses.

p
    em
        strong We argue that the level of admin and accountability expected should be proportional to the size of the ministry.

p It is appropriate to directly support individuals with personal income when the amount would not exceed the wages for a reasonable living.

    div Wasting time
    p Peter is an app developer and has some ideas for evangelistic apps. He wonders if people will give money to help fund them but a friend says it is wrong to receive money directly and he should start a non-profit organisation instead. He spends many weeks researching non-profit organisations and how to set them up, then even longer finding people to be part of his board. Some of the board members don't really understand apps while others do but aren't very mature in their faith. At the end of the first year Peter realises he's spent more time setting up his non-profit than he has actually making apps.


h2 Accountability emphasised over genuine integrity

p At a theological level, we've emphasised trusting policies and safeguards rather than ensuring people are genuinely trustworthy. Such policies and safeguards are usually good things but they do not get to the heart of the matter.

p We do not want people in ministry who love money but are restrained from acting out their sinful desires merely because of some policies that make it difficult to. We don't want people who only steward resources well because there is accountability in place. We want people who are genuinely godly and trustworthy, who will do the right thing whether someone is watching or not.

p None of the assurances given by Christian organisations guarantee there won't be any improper use of funds. An organisation can have endless layers of accountability and still fall into sin. There are #[GO(href='https://ministrywatch.com/') countless testimonies] to this from otherwise well respected organisations. On the other hand, someone can receive funds directly into their personal bank account without any accountability and be completely righteous in their behavior.

h2 Supporting causes AND people

p With the church's increased focus on organisational structures, it has become rare to support someone in ministry by directly giving to them. Yet this was how ministry was funded in the early church. Paul did not set up a non-profit for his ministry, people gave directly to him (Phil 4:15-18). Likewise, John encouraged believers to directly support evangelists (3 John 1:5-8).

    div The current culture of support
    p Susan is writing a book about trusting God when under financial stress, but she can't afford to spend much time on it. Someone mentioned raising money for it but she's never seen anyone else do that before, as it seems to be only something churches and missionaries do. A publisher offers her an advance for her book, which she accepts, as she assumes it will reach a larger audience that way anyway. Her book sells well but she finds it only reaches middle-high income earners, even though she had intended it to help those worse off.

p Not only were people in ministry supported, but their families were provided for as well (1 Cor 9:5). The church has kept up this practice in regards to missionaries, and sometimes in regards to pastors. If one spouse wishes to do mission, the church does not send them out alone, the whole family is sent out together as one unit.

p It is of course also biblical to support causes (Rom 15:25-27) rather than just people. The point is that Christians should not shy away from directly supporting those engaged in ministry and should not limit them to a single cause. Someone may be involved in a variety of different ministries, but only funding them for a particular cause can restrict the good they are able to do in other areas.


h2 Misconceptions about the accountability organisations provide

p Organisational structures can be helpful, but their strengths are often outweighed by their weaknesses when applied to small ministries. Small ministries being the target market of this platform.

p What do non-profits actually provide? And how does that compare with directly supporting people?


h3 Organisations ensure funds are kept track of

p The most basic form of accountability is actually keeping track of how much money is coming in. Organisations usually have someone dedicated to this task, carefully keeping account of all income and expenditure.

p However, there is no reason why an individual cannot do this themselves. Small ministries often have so few transactions that they can fit on a single page, so extensive accounting is not necessary.

    div Excessive accounting wastes money
    p Simon helps the poor in his neighbourhood. He's heard of financial abuse in other charities and wants to make sure his work is above reproach, so he starts a non-profit and does an independent audit each year. He manages to raise $30,000 in donations, but $10,000 of that is spent on the independent audit each year, and another $5,000 for other admin, leaving only 50% for giving to the poor.


h3 Organisations ensure secure means of payment

p It used to be the case that securely processing payments, especially card payments, online was something reserved for organisations. But thanks to new online services, like Stripe and PayPal, anyone can securely accept online payment without having to handle the details themselves.

p But this also means the most efficient means of donating is not always utilised because organisations are more concerned about locking in donors by getting their card details, rather than letting them set up their own scheduled payments.

    div Inefficient means of payment
    p Jess has been told that getting people to give regularly is the most stable way to fund a ministry and she should join an organisation as they support paying by credit card. One of her supporters asks if they can just do a bank transfer to avoid the surcharge credit cards apply. But her organisation tells her the supporter might drop off if they can't keep her card details for regular payments. Jess regularly loses 1-2% of donations due to card surcharges.

h3 Organisations ensure funds are used appropriately

p Most organisations will only publish what they believe their donors want to hear. As such, they usually sound like they are doing what they should be doing. But history is #[GO(href='https://ministrywatch.com/') full of examples] where this has failed to be the case, and it is usually only discovered after such inappropriate practices have been going on for a long time.

p Most small ministries are supported by those who themselves see the fruit that is being produced. The donors know the people in ministry personally and/or witness the work being done. There is less of a need for internal accountability when the fruits of a ministry are self-evident.

    div Limiting ministry opportunities
    p Gary disciples students at a university and is glad to be part of an organisation focused on student ministry. A muslim student came to faith and then graduated the same year. Garry continues to meet with him and his friends as they are open to hearing more about Jesus, but his supervisor reminds him that he's being supported for student ministry, not muslim ministry. Garry doesn't know of any organisations in his area working with muslims, so he reluctantly reduces his time reaching out to muslims and only reaches out to his friend in his free time.



h3 Organisations ensure the ministry is non-profit

p Some Christian organisations are actually for-profit and it can be hard to know which as they rarely make this obvious. Regarding organisations that are set up as non-profits, it's important to realise this is a legal distinction and not a biblical one. A non-profit organisation can only use its funds to further the cause it was set up for, but there are few restrictions on how much it may pay its staff.

p It is common practice for Christian organisations to compare to each other when setting executive pay, or even compare to the secular world. In other words the policy is "we'll do what everyone else is doing". As a result there are Christian CEOs that receive over $400k USD (Compassion), $800k (Samaritan's Purse), or even $7 million (Inspiration Ministries). While the later is associated with false teachers, it still goes to show that it is legal to pay incredibly high salaries for non-profit executives.

    div Commercialising ministry
    p Clare dedicates a lot of her time to writing worship songs. She has a part-time job put she's still eating into her savings. There aren't any organisations that would allow her to raise money for her songs so she is forced to go with a commercial publisher instead. Churches pay her royalties whenever they sing her songs but CCLI takes a cut and so does her publisher, leaving her with less than 50%. She gets by, but no one is allowed to sing her songs unless they pay because they are copyrighted.









h3 Organisations ensure someone's beliefs are biblical

p While organisations usually have a statement of beliefs, they usually only cover the very basics of the faith. There is nothing stopping staff from holding unbiblical beliefs that they simply don't make known or don't make a big deal of. Since organisations often provide attractive employment opportunities, there is the added incentive to hide such beliefs. Likewise, in regard to donors, the organisation has an incentive to attract donors from as large a pool of believers as possible.

p Individuals and small ministries on the other hand may not even publish a statement of beliefs, but it is far more likely that donors know them personally. Most small ministries will be primarily be supported by friends and family of those doing the ministry; people who know the person's beliefs very well.



h2 A reasonable alternative for small ministries


p As we've seen, organisations only lower risk, not eliminate it, and they lower it at a cost. A cost that is not always appropriate for low risk scenarios. We've also seen that there is nothing inherently wrong with directly giving someone money, and it is much more efficient in terms of both time and money for small ministries.

p
    strong Responsibility of fundraisers:
ul
    li Keep track of donations
    li Raise a sum that is reasonable (for your circumstances, not for an equivalent career)
    li Encourage donors to give to other ministries when sufficiently funded

p
    strong Responsibility of donors:
ul
    li Ensure you trust the people fundraising (either personally or based on the fruit of their ministry)

p We require all fundraisers to promise to carefully steward what is given to them and to be honest with how much they are raising. While there are no legal means of accountability, it is biblical to not be overly concerned about bringing people to justice ourselves (Prov 20:22, Rom 12:19, 1 Cor 6:7).


div.cs-positive
    div
    p Clare dedicates Fridays to writing worship songs and hopes to raise $15,000 USD / year to help do this. She opens an online savings account to receive donations into and occasionally transfers them into her transactions account. At the end of the year she simply checks the income total of the donations account to know how much she has received.
