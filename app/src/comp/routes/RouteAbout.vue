//- h2 Backstory

//- p Over the last several decades, some Christian ministries have grown into large entities

//- p Ministries grow and dominate fundraising. Smaller ministries struggle to stay on top of compliance and to fundraise. Leading to the evangelical industrial complex. Centralising ministry into large organizations has not resulted in biblical faithfulness but rather the diluting of beliefs to stay compatible with a large pool of donors.

//- p Individuals are forced to join a large organization or commercialise their ministry.

//- p The name comes from the dorean principle.

//- p Jon Here<br>Founder of Gracious Tech
