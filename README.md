Source code for [colabor.ing](https://colabor.ing)


## TODO

 * Optionally receive email reminders to donate (especially for Bitcoin, e.g. donate monthly/yearly)
 * Collect email addresses so can send notifications when new updates
 * Collect amount expected to pay so can issue receipts
    * Should be able to send receipt with single button as soon as funds confirmed in account


# NSW Law
Platform is not considered a "trader" due to "If a crowdfunding platform obtains a benefit for hosting the fundraising appeal or conducts fundraising appeals for business or trade, they are considered to be a trader for the purposes of Section 11 of the Act."

If platform were a trader then there would be regulations that we'd need to follow.

# ASIC
ASIC does not regulate donation-based funding (only equity-based)

"This guide does not provide guidance about non-investment crowd-sourced funding, including donation-based crowd-sourced funding and funding based on the pre-purchase of goods and services other than financial products and services. This type of crowd-sourced funding is not regulated by ASIC."

From "REGULATORY GUIDE 262: Crowd-sourced funding: Guide for intermediaries" (page 8)
